A list of docker compose files for my home server.

This started as me just exploring docker compose and organizing my media so I started writing all these somewhat manually.
Eventually once i had something kinda working I ended up finding [EZARR](https://github.com/Luctia/ezarr/tree/main) which was basically everything I wanted to put together and more. I started adapting what I had already with the guidance of this other repository.
